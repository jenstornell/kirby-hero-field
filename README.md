# Kirby Boiler Field

*Version 2.0*

There is not much documentation about Kirby form fields. As a solution to the problem I created a boilerplate for it.

**[Intallation instructions](docs/install.md)**

## Features

### Textfield

- Extends basefield.
- Includes field [routes](https://forum.getkirby.com/t/routing-in-custom-form-field/3101/7).
- [Connects field to javascript](https://forum.getkirby.com/t/panel-field-javascript-click-does-not-work-after-save/3474/7).
- Includes ajax request. Output data to the console.

### Checkboxesfield

- Extends checkboxesfield.
- Inherit values from the options.
- Appends own values.

## Setup

### Blueprint

To make it work as expected, add the following code to your blueprint:

#### Textfield

```text
fields:
  boilertext:
    title: Your Field1
    type: boilertext
```

#### Checkboxfield

```text
fields:
  boilercheckboxes:
    title: Your Field2
    type: boilercheckboxes
```
